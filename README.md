This vagrant file is used to boot a 4 node flocker cluster, with
a client node, control node, and two agent nodes.

This file assumes the [Vagrant Host Manager](https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-hostmanager) plugin is installed. After booting the cluster, update the hostnames when needed via `vagrant hostmanager`.
